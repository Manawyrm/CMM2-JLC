Colour Maximite 2 - JLC-ready design
=============================
![PCB](gerbers/RevA/RevAPCB.jpg)

#### Overview

This is a open-source hardware clone PCB of the [Colour Maximite 2](https://geoffg.net/maximite.html) computer.  
It's fully compatible to the original firmware and software.  

- Designed for automated assembly at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/DDE), everything except the connectors can be machine assembled.  
- USB-C port (instead of USB-B) for serial and power  
- microSD socket instead of full-size SD socket  
- STM32 and SDRAM directly onboard, no expensive evaluation board needed

#### Rev.A Errata
- Missing mounting holes
- SDRAM pinout is missing A12 line 
(causes instability, fixed in Rev.B, workaround with enamelled copper wire of the same length as the other traces)
- SRV05 diode package had the Pin 1 indicator at Pin 6.  
- Nunchuck footprint is reversed

#### Rev. B Errata
- KiCad Bug caused data corruption in PCB files, board files were reset back to pre-RevA state (missing via stitching). Will still work. 
- SRV05 diode package had the Pin 1 indicator at Pin 6.  
- Nunchuck footprint is reversed

#### Rev. C Errata
- SRV05 diode package had the Pin 1 indicator at Pin 6.  
- Nunchuck footprint is reversed

#### Rev. D Errata
- SRV05 diode package had the Pin 1 indicator at Pin 6.
